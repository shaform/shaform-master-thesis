\label{c:intro}

Natural language understanding has always been an important goal in Artificial
Intelligence. There are many applications including natural language user
interface and large-scale content-analysis. However, the task is also considered
as very difficult because there are often many ambiguities in a seemingly
simple sentence. Moreover, real world knowledge is required to fully understand
the concepts involved in the text.

Researchers deal with this problem by dividing it into subtasks such as lexical
analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and discourse analysis. Building
upon each component that was perfected over the years and the large-scale
annotated data sets, researchers start to handle the complex discourse relations
between textual units.

The goal of this research is to build an end-to-end system to analyze the explicit discourse
connectives in Chinese texts. This includes (1) the extraction of discourse connective
components, (2) the disambiguation for linkings between connective components, (3) the classification
of the relation type for each discourse, and (4) the extraction of arguments for each discourse connective.

Such a system could be incorporated. Eventually build a discourse parser.
