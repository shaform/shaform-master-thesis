\section{English Discourse Parsing}

Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB)~\citep{Prasad08thepenn} is a large
corpus with discourse relations annotated over the Wall Street Journal
articles. Many groups have investigated different subtasks of English
discourse parsing on this corpus. \cite{pitler2009using} trained a maximum
entropy classifier with various syntactic features to identify explicit discourse
connectives in PDTB and achieved the F1 of 94.19\%. Additionally, they used
a Naive Bayes classifier to classify the relation type of each connective and
archived the accuracy of 94.15\%. Such high performance is already
comparable to human annotator agreement.
